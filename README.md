## Warning: Backup Your Database

Before installing or using this plugin, it is **highly recommended** that you create a backup of your Dispatcharr database. This plugin creates and modifies channel groups, channels, and stream assignments.

**[Click here for instructions on how to back up your database.](https://dispatcharr.github.io/Dispatcharr-Docs/troubleshooting/?h=backup#how-can-i-make-a-backup-of-the-database)**

## What it does

You pick a real provider lineup, such as Sky TV or DIRECTV Premier, and the plugin builds those channel groups and channels in Dispatcharr and attaches your own streams to them by name.

- **Builds the lineup.** Channel groups and channels that mirror the provider's package, keeping the provider's channel numbers.
- **Matches your streams to it.** A four stage pipeline: alias, exact, substring, then fuzzy token sort, with US broadcast callsign anchoring and length scaled thresholds to keep false positives down. Four sensitivity presets from Relaxed to Exact.
- **Keeps reviewed false positives out.** Optional per-channel `excluded_aliases` block a known wrong stream before any positive matching stage without suppressing it from other channels.
- **Rejects streams from the wrong country.** A lineup keeps only same country or untagged streams. Detection covers the tag formats real providers use, including parenthesized, colon separated, box bar separated, bare space, and country glued to a quality tag. When a stream name carries no country at all, the provider group it came from is read instead, which is what catches a provider that labels streams by platform rather than by country.
- **Knows about regional variants**, so an East, West or Pacific channel reaches the matching regional stream.
- **Assigns EPG data and logos.** Programme guides from any configured EPG source, and logos from EPG icons, the Logo Manager, or the [tv-logos](https://github.com/tv-logo/tv-logos) repository.
- **Orders streams by quality**, 4K before UHD before FHD before HD before SD, using the name or [IPTV Checker](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-IPTV-Checker-Plugin) metadata.
- **Previews before it commits.** A dry run writes a CSV of what would match and how confidently, so you can read it first.
- **Reports what it did.** A shareable HTML page and CSV per run, optionally emailed through the [Newsflasharr](https://github.com/PiratesIRC/Dispatcharr-Newsflasharr-Plugin) plugin.
- **Adds without destroying.** An optional mode appends matched streams instead of replacing them, so a second M3U source can be layered on safely.
- **Runs inside Dispatcharr** with direct database access, so no API credentials are needed.

Over 200 built-in channel aliases, plus your own in JSON. Every setting and action is covered in the [user guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md).

These are community-compiled channel lists based on publicly available provider lineup information. You can write your own: see the [lineup file format](docs/LINEUP-FORMAT.md).

The Verizon FiOS ZIP 11743 lineup is the one to look at if you are writing your own: 434 of its channels carry their own alias lists, which is the per-channel `aliases` array described in that format guide. The three Spectrum Tampa Bay lineups use the same array on every channel.

## Requirements

- Dispatcharr v0.20.0 or newer
- At least one M3U source configured with streams
- EPG sources configured, optional, for EPG matching

No API credentials are needed. The plugin runs inside Dispatcharr with direct database access.

## Install

1. Log in to Dispatcharr's web interface.
2. Go to **Plugins**.
3. Click **Import Plugin** and upload `Lineuparr.zip`.
4. Enable the plugin.

Then pick a lineup file and an M3U source, save, and run **Validate Settings** followed by **Preview Stream Match**. The [user guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md#the-short-version) walks through it.

Lineuparr can download a generated lineup from GraceNoteScraper or another trusted HTTP service. Enter the **Generated Lineup URL**, select **Lineup from URL** once, then run **Import / Refresh Generated Lineup**. Dispatcharr saves panel settings before the action; no separate save is needed. This permanent option follows the latest successful import with **Exact** matching, regardless of the sensitivity dropdown. Proceed directly to Preview without toggling the plugin. Individual imported files remain saved under `/data/lineuparr/lineups` and appear separately after reloading the plugin. Imports do not override an explicitly selected built-in or individual lineup.

### Updating

Remove the old plugin from the **Plugins** page, restart Dispatcharr (`docker restart dispatcharr`), then import the new zip and enable it. Your settings are kept, but check them after upgrading.

## Documentation

| Page | What is in it |
|---|---|
| **[User guide](docs/USER-GUIDE.md)** | Every setting, every action, match sensitivity, country matching, custom aliases, reports and emailing, file locations, troubleshooting, and how the matching pipeline works. |
| **[Lineup file format](docs/LINEUP-FORMAT.md)** | Writing your own lineup: the JSON shape, the filename rule, per-channel aliases, and marking foreign channels. |

## Contributing

### Reporting issues

1. Include your Dispatcharr version.
2. Provide relevant container logs: `docker logs dispatcharr | grep "Lineuparr"`.
3. Run **Preview Stream Match** and attach the CSV export. This is the most useful thing you can share. **Check that no stream URLs are in the CSV before sharing it**, because they can carry your provider credentials.
4. Say which **Match Sensitivity** setting and lineup file you used.

### Submitting lineup databases

Community-contributed lineups are welcome. The JSON shape and the filename rule are in the [lineup file format](docs/LINEUP-FORMAT.md). Open a pull request with the file, or an issue giving the provider name, country, channel list and where the listing came from.

If you would like a provider added but cannot build the file yourself, open a **Lineup Request** issue with the provider name, country, and a link to their channel listing page.

### Bumping the plugin version

Version format is `1.26.{DDD}{HHMM}`, a three digit day of year plus a four digit UTC time. Both `Lineuparr/plugin.json` and `PluginConfig.PLUGIN_VERSION` in `Lineuparr/plugin.py` must stay in step, so use the helper rather than editing them by hand:

```bash
python3 bump_version.py              # auto from the current UTC time
python3 bump_version.py 1.26.1031200 # explicit
```

## Disclaimer

**Lineuparr provides no television content of any kind.** It supplies no channels, no playlists, no streams, no electronic programme guide data and no provider accounts, and it contains no list of where to obtain any of those. The lineup files it ships are lists of channel names and channel numbers, compiled from publicly available provider channel listings. They contain no stream addresses, no credentials and no provider account details.

The plugin never contacts a media provider. It never opens, fetches, decodes, records, restreams or redistributes any stream. It reads the stream names, EPG entries and channels that Dispatcharr already holds for the sources **you** configured, matches them by name against a lineup you chose, and writes the results back into Dispatcharr. Its own network requests are limited to the generated lineup URL you explicitly save and refresh, and the [tv-logos](https://github.com/tv-logo/tv-logos) repository on GitHub when you ask it to assign channel logos.

**You are responsible for what you connect Dispatcharr to.** Whether a particular provider, subscription, playlist or stream is lawful for you to use depends on your agreement with that provider and on the law where you live. Use only sources you are authorised to use. Nothing in this project is intended to enable, encourage or assist access to content you have no right to access.

All product names, channel names, trademarks and registered trademarks mentioned in this project or appearing in its lineup files are the property of their respective owners. This project is an independent, community-built plugin. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by any television network, broadcaster, streaming service or IPTV provider, and it is not affiliated with the Dispatcharr project beyond being a plugin written for it.
